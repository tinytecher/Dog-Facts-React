# Project: Dog Facts App with Lottie Animations

This project is a Dog Facts app built using React.js and Lottie animations. The app displays interesting facts about dogs and features a fun animation using Lottie to enhance the user experience.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into several key areas:

### React.js Fundamentals

I deepened my understanding of React.js by working on this project. I learned about functional components, state management using the `useState` hook, and the concept of rendering components based on conditions using conditional rendering.

### Component Lifecycle and `useEffect`

I explored the `useEffect` hook in React to manage side effects, such as rendering Lottie animations. I learned how to initialize and destroy animations to prevent duplicate rendering and optimize performance.

### Lottie Animations Integration

I integrated Lottie animations into the app to create an engaging and visually appealing experience. By loading animations with the `lottie-web` library, I gained practical knowledge of using external libraries to enhance UI elements.

### Responsive Design and Styling

I practiced responsive design principles using CSS to ensure that the app looks visually appealing on different screen sizes. I utilized CSS classes to style components and improve the overall user interface.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several key files and components:

- `App.js`: The main component that displays a random dog fact and toggles the display of a Lottie animation on button click.
- `App.css`: The CSS file for styling the main app component.
- `Dog.js`: A component responsible for rendering the Lottie animation using the `lottie-web` library.
- `Dog.css`: The CSS file for styling the Lottie animation component.
- `DogFactsReact.js`: A component to update the number of dog facts to display (commented out in the code you provided).

## Usage

To run the project locally, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the app.

## Acknowledgments

This project was a valuable learning experience that helped me deepen my knowledge of React.js, state management, animations, and responsive design. By combining React.js and Lottie animations, I was able to create an interactive and visually engaging Dog Facts app.
